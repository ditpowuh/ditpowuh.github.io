      <p>You may currently be wondering who I am.</p>
      <p>Hi there. My name is Ditpowuh, which obviously isn't not my real name; it's a pseudonym.</p>
      <p>Anyways, I play video games as well as make them. I also create music and other things.</p>
      <p>I'm currently in a series of fandoms right now.</p>
      <p>I also seem to like programming and coding as this website is made with HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, that would be enough information for you.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="pixeltext">Thank you for reading.</p>
