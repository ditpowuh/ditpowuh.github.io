        You may currently be wondering who I am.
        <br>
        Hi there. My name is Ditpowuh, which obviously isn't not my real name; it's a pseudonym.
        <br>
        Anyways, I play video games as well as make them. I also create music and other things.
        <br>
        I'm currently in a series of fandoms right now.
        <br>
        I also seem to like programming and coding as this website is made with HTML, CSS and JS.
        <br>
        Hopefully, that would be enough information for you.
      </p>
